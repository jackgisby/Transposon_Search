# Transposon_Search
 Initial transposon search work Pack-CACTA

## To-Do
- Implement stage 2 of algorithm (BLAST to identify autonomous transposable elements)
- Improve error and false-negative rate
-- Difficulty improving false-negative rate due to altered TIR sequence, have to choose between accepting many more false-positives or missing out 2/7 of the complete pack-CACTA elements
-- Error rate will be improved by implementation of BLAST filtering
- Collate information on the algorithm's current issues
