\title{Get Flanking Terminal Site Duplication Sequences}
\usage{
getTsds(tirMatches, Genome, tsdLength, strand = "+",
  output = "character")
}
\arguments{
\item{tirMatches}{A dataframe containing genomic ranges and names referring to TIR sequences or
predicted Pack-TYPE transposable elements. Should be in the format used by
\code{\link{packSearch}}.}

\item{Genome}{A DNAStringSet object containing sequences referred to in \code{tirMatches}.}

\item{tsdLength}{The length of the TSD region to be retrieved (integer).}

\item{strand}{The strand of the TIR; "+" for forward, "-" for reverse. If the TSD sequences
of transposable elements are being predicted, then this parameter can be left
as default ("+"); if the TSD sequences of TIRs are being found then the
strand direction must be supplied.}

\item{output}{The type of object to be returned:
\itemize{
 \item output = "DNAStringSet", returns a
 \code{\link[Biostrings]{DNAStringSet}} object.
 \item output = "character", returns a \code{character} vector (default).
 }}
}
\value{
Flanking TSD sequences as a vector of characters, or if output is specified
as "DNAStringSet", TSD sequences will be returned as a
\code{\link[Biostrings]{DNAStringSet}} object.
}
\description{
Gets the flanking TSD sequences of TIRs or predicted Pack-TYPE transposable
elements. A dataframe of these elements can be  in \code{tirMatches}.
}
\details{
Called by \code{\link{packSearch}}. It is recommended to use the general
pipeline function \code{\link{packSearch}} for identification of potential
pack elements, which returns TSD sequences as a feature of results, however
each stage may be called individually.
